<p>The goal of the first plot was to provide some sort of insight
    into how I should approach modeling the data. The hope was
    that there would be some sort of pattern that I could
    see that would lend the data to multiple regression model
    or there would be strong clustering, so that maybe I could
    do some analysis within neighborhoods, but nothing concrete appeared.
</p>
<p>The second and third plots were there in case I missed some sort
    of pattern when looking at them together, than if I had tried to
    find some correlation individually. There were some data points with
    incredibly high weekly incomes, so the data has been limited to just prices
    below 10,000 for these two graphs. This was to search for patterns in the majority
    of data and not those that strayed far from the average. These yielded
    inconclusive as well.
